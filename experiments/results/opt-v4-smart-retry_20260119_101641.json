For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.\n- JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.\n- JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.",
