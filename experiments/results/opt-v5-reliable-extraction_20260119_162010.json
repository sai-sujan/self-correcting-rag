It works by using digital signatures, where users sign transactions with their private key (Privkey), which can be verified by others using the public key (Pubkey). This process is akin to placing a tamper-proof seal on a jar to protect its contents. Additionally, hash functions are used to maintain the integrity and order of the blockchain by creating unique digital fingerprints for data, ensuring that any alteration in the input changes the hash significantly.",
        "retrieved_docs": "- Cryptography: A set of techniques and algorithms that ensure the security and integrity of data stored and transmitted on a blockchain network. Cryptography plays a crucial role in maintaining the decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof nature of blockchain systems.\n\n---\n\n## **References**  \nIBM. Blockchain defined: Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking\nassets, and building trust. Available at: https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain (Accessed: [date]).  \nNakamoto, S. Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. Available at: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\n(Accessed: 30/11/2023).  \nHow the Byzantine General Sacked the Castle: A Look Into Blockchain. Medium. Available at:\nhttps://medium.com/@DebrajG/how-the-byzantine-gener...\n\n---\n\n- To grasp what Cryptography entails, think of it as a tamper-proof seal on a jar. If the seal is broken (akin to the cryptographic rules being violated), the contents of the jar might have been tampered with. Just like how the seal protects the jar, cryptography protects the information on the blockchain.\n- When we discuss blockchain cryptography, this entails the following components:  \n  - **Digital Signatures:** the purpose of digital signatures is to ensure security and authenticity. To achieve this, when a user makes a transaction, they sign it with their private key (a secret code known only to them, also known as Privkey). Others can use the sender's public key (a code that everyone can see, also known as Pubkey) to verify that the transaction was indeed created by the rightful owner of the private key. Imagine the public key as something like a bank account number, and the private key as a secret PIN or a signature on a check, which gives you control over the account.\n- **Hash Functions** are used to maintain the integrity and the order of the blockchain. In practice, a hash function is like a digital fingerprint for data. It takes any input (like a block of transactions) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is unique to that specific input. Any small change in the input data changes this hash drastically. Each block in the blockchain contains the hash of the previous block, creating a secure link.",

This may span multiple lines.\n- JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence <!--. JavaScript treats this as a single-line comment, just as it does the // comment.\n- The following example shows how to use comments in JavaScript.\n```\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n<!-\n// This is a comment.

        "answer": "To write your first JavaScript code, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Use a script tag in your HTML document.\n2. Set the `language` attribute to \"javascript\" (though this is now deprecated) and the `type` attribute to \"text/javascript\".\n3. Optionally enclose your JavaScript code within an HTML comment to ensure it's ignored by browsers that don't support JavaScript, ending with \"//-->\".\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example to print \"Hello World\":\n\n```html\n<html>\n<body>\n\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n<!-\ndocument.write (\"Hello World!\")\n\n//-->\n\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code will display \"Hello World!\" when the page is loaded.",
        "retrieved_docs": "- The script tag takes two important attributes:\n  - **Language:** This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using.\n    Typically, its value will be javascript. Although recent versions of HTML (and\n    XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.\n  - **Type:** This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting\n    language in use and its value should be set to \"text/javascript\".\n- So your JavaScript syntax will look as follows.\n```\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n\nJavaScript code\n\n</script>\n```  \n- Let us take a sample example to print out \"Hello World\". We added an optional HTML\n  comment that surrounds our JavaScript code. This is to save our code from a browser\n  that does not support JavaScript. The comment ends with a \"//-->\". Here \"//\"\n  signifies a comment in JavaScript, so we add that to prevent a browser from reading\n  the end of the HTML comment as a piece of JavaScript code.\n- Next, we call a function **document.write** which writes a string into our HTML document.\n  This function can be used to write text, HTML, or both. Take a look at the following\n  code.\n```\n<html>\n\n<body>\n\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n<!-\ndocument.write (\"Hello World!\")\n\n//-->\n\n</script>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n```  \n- This code will produce the following result:\n```\nHello World!\n```\n\n---\n\n## **About the Tutorial**  \nJavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
